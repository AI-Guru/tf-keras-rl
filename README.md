# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Tensorflow-Keras

This is an attempt at porting Keras-RL to Tensorflow 2.0

I had to turn of eager execution.

Optimizer needs name issue?

## Example agents.

- cem_cartpole.py running.
- ddpg_pendulum.py NOT RUNNING. Optimizer needs name issue.
- dqn_cartpole.py running.
- naf_pendulum.py NOT RUNNING AttributeError: Tensor object has no attribute keras_shape
- ddpg_mujoco.py NOT RUNNING
- dqn_atari.py NOT RUNNING
- duel_dqn_cartpole.py NOT RUNNING
- sarsa_cartpole.py running.
